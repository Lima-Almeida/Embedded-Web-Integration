# Embedded-Web-Integration
 Personal test for a greater project.

 The ideia is to test and develop a system where I can analyze motion sensor signals and update (in real time) a webpage that shows them.

 Goal 1: set every package and test a system that allows the user to turn a LED on/off using Arduino and buttons on a webpage.

 Goal 1 Notes: The port used was the COM3 (script.js:11)
 Pay attention to th compatibility between JS Client and Socket.IO server versions (packages installed need to be compatible with the version specified on client-side file)
